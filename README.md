# CSS Talk

This is code I used for a CSS talk, with examples, adjustable code, built with Svelte.
It's only meant to be run locally during my talk, so user input is not sanitized.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then build it

```bash
npm run build
```

... then serve the page and start the image delay proxy ðŸš€

```bash
npm run presententation
```

If you're on Window the `&` command will not work, but you can run the
commands `start` and `image-proxy` independently.
